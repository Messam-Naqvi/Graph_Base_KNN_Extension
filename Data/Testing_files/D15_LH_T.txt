Analysis of lifestyle of young adults in the rural and urban 
 An unhealthy lifestyle among young people is a serious and often unnoticed problem. It seems that there are differences in the lifestyle of young people from rural and urban areas. The objective of this study was to compare eating habits and physical activity of young adults according to their body weight, gender and place of residence. The study involved a group of 18-year-olds from rural and urban environments. The study included 50% girls and 50% of boys in each group, selected by simple random sampling (SRS). The author-designed questionnaire evaluating the nutrition habits and physical activity was provided. It was found that in the group of boys the value of BMI was markedly higher than in girls. Compared to the normal weight, young overweight adults ate meals more frequency, the majority preferred meat dishes, more often ate under the stress, and had lower physical activity. It was found that gender had a significant impact on the studied parameters. The girls ate meals more frequent during the day, the majority preferred fruit and vegetable, but had lower physical activity than the boys. It was found that the young adults from the rural area preferred fast food and frequently ate sweets. Compared to the subjects from the urban environment, the young adults living in the countryside consumed fewer meals daily and were more physical active. About a half of the studied adults were not satisfied with their weight, and nearly 40% of the subjects in both groups admitted that they had made effective or ineffective attempts to lose weight. The lifestyles of young people in rural and urban areas were slightly different; however, dietary factors which predispose to weight gain were comparable in both groups. In the rural areas, the most frequent nutritional faults were a preference for fast food, frequent consumption of sweets, and few meals during the day. A positive aspect of the lifestyle of young people in the rural areas was a relatively high level of physical activity and the small effect of stress on excessive consumption Good nutrition, a physically active lifestyle and absence of the use of tobacco and alcohol may delay or prevent the onset of cardiovascular disease. In the past few decades, physical activity patterns in adolescents have changed as a result of increased television watching, spending much time at a computer, and spending less time at physical activities in schools and communities. Improving diet and physical activity has been emphasized by many national scientific societies, e.g. the American Heart Association (AHA) and Polish Society of Cardiology as one of their primary aims [2It is well known that the ability to lead a healthy lifestyle depends on various environmental factors, such as the level of nutrition education, access to sports facilities, and eating habits [5, 6, 7]. There are some data which confirm the significant impact of body mass and gender on life style [1, 8]. Little research has been conducted on comparisons of eating habits and physical activity between the urban and rural environments. The objective of this study was estimation of the lifestyle of young adults according the body mass, gender and place of residence.
