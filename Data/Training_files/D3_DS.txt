fda provided emergency use authorization two bivalent booster vaccine mrna vaccine genetic code ancestral sarscov2 strain also include updated mrna code shared component ba4 ba5 latter prevalent omicron subvariant circulating united state exciting new covid19 booster however explain know bivalent booster human date get short primer immunology including antibody cell cell antibody one arm immune system generated infection vaccine antibody wane time otherwise blood would thick paste vaccine infection seen think antibody especially nose mucosal surface like antibody called immunoglobulin protective mild covid19 infection luckily vaccine infection also generate something called cellular immunity cell 
much longer lasting protects severe disease enduring fashion memory cell generated vaccine result prior infection shown recognize virus including variant think memory cell recipe make antibody see virus future specifically antibody adapted see front example memory cell see variant able make antibody adapted variant like baker adjusts amount yeast cake made different altitude although know long memory cell covid19 last survivor 1918 influenza pandemic able produce antibody memory cell blood exposed strain nine decade later vaccine natural infection also trigger production cell though cell serve memory bank produce antibody needed cell help cell make antibody help recruit cell attack pathogen directly memory cell generated covid19 may last lifetime according study examined participant varying degree initial disease severity memory cell generated individual survived different coronavirus infection 2003 shown 2020 paper last least year omicron subvariant surge spring 2022 see greater chance reinfection compared previous variant severe disease across general population defanging even significant upon closer analysis hospitalization death data particularly state like massachusetts across health system track hospitalization detail although subvariant omicron bq1 bq11 ba275 may lead mild infection high amount population cellular immunity phase pandemic keeping global daily confirmed death peak first pandemic winter starting end 2020 need new booster important paper published new england journal medicine utilized israeli data study effectiveness nirmatrelvir paxlovid age group study tell highly immune population still risk severe disease omicron era specifically individual aged year older another recent study among million individual united kingdom demonstrates first booster third shot reduced severe disease two vaccine dos mainly older people age year older well five comorbidities immunosuppressant chronic kidney disease focus goal booster strategy preventing severe disease older people multiple medical condition going need new adapted booster others population protected effective cellular immune response reason focus effort older stage pandemic population older year received first booster tailoring messaging boosting effort group risk may effective public health strategy going forward follow medscape facebook twitter instagram youtube 2022 webmd llc view expressed author necessarily reflect view webmd medscape
